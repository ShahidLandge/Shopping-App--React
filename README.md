##	Project Name - User Authenticated Shopping Website Using React

##	Project Description :
It is a simple user authenticated shopping application where user can navigate to different pages without reloading the entire website.

## Why this project was chosen (what use case does it solve) ?
It helps to understand the  basic concept of react-router and context API.
The user will be able to see the products and profile page only when he sign-up first and then log in with the correct username and password. On the Products page,  user can search the product in the search bar, as soon as he starts typing in the search bar, products will be shown to him if available. Also, users can sort the products based on low and high prices and add and delete the items from the cart.


##	What features, technical things you had implemented ?
  The main technical features in my project:
- The use of Local storage to store user details which helps in authentication.
- The Proper use of Fetch API.
- The use of Loader before data is fetched from the API.

##  Tech Stack: HTML , CSS , React.
